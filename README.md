bananacode
==========
is an online programming code grader, can be used for grading the code in competitions easily
by evaluation solutions from executed code and compare to the predetermined solutions.

<h4>bananacode</h4> require only PHP and MYSQL, of course on the WAMP, MAMP, XAMPP or any web server stack package.

Do not really need to use a hosting server to manage your grader, but need to open a runnable jar file all time
to execute the code and evaluate the solution.
